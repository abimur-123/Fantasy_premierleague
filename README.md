#### Work in progress....

Football is a game that has more influence of luck compared to other games, which is what makes it extemely hard to predict and exciting at the same time. The role of a manager in a football team if to put together a stating eleven group of players that they think would help the team win a game. This role can be extremely challenging and rewarding.

With FPL, each and every one of us could participate in a simluation where we act as the manager and pick a group of eleven players that we think will perform well during that week. FPL removes the restriction of having to pick players only from one team which makes it a really hard and an interesting competition ([more rules here](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/help/)). Each year, this game draws close to 3 million participants every week who want to be crowned FPL champion.

I have been trying my hand at this game for the past 4 years and have been consistently finishing within the top 10%. This year I want to try and use machine learning to pick a team, instead of trusting my intuition. I hope to break into the top 1% using my data science knowledge.

I am going to try and predict how many points a player would score in a) next game and b) next 3 games and put together a team.
